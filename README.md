Data information

My data is coming from a Super Zip shiny example. Itâ€™s data is from the census in 2010. I followed part of this example and extended to meet the need of this project.

The main data has about 31,000 records. There is another data table have to be used to make the map. I use the prepared data of that example.

The main variables are include:
* zipzode: all the zipcode in the United States, one zipcode one record,
* state, all the States in the United States including Washington D.C.,
* county,
* city,
* population(adult population in the zipcode area),
* college(the percentage of adult college with college level of the zipcode area),
* income (the median income of this zipcode),
* rank (the rank of the percentile of the population greater than 5)
* centile (percentile of the income of this zipcode)
